# Simple To-do list
The goal of this project is to practice JavaScript and its paradigms by creating
a TODO app. This app should be able to add TODOs and track the number of total
TODOs as well as the number of unchecked TODOs.


This project was built as part of the CS50 course: Mobile App Development with React Native.
